## Description

This website was created for a friend's business. It counts with a swiper to display images of their work. It also counts with a "contact us" page that takes the user to a page with a form. Thanks to a third party api, the user is able to submit said form and its information goes to a Google spreadsheet. The goal was to create a webpage that was functional, fast to load, and simple for the user.  

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the latest git version and the latest Visual Studio Code version.
